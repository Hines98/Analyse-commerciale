# Sales report

## Context
As a Power BI developer at Maximoff Traders, a leading software company, my mission is to facilitate access to key business information through an interactive dashboard. The goal is to centralize and make critical sales indicators easily accessible for business users, enabling them to track business performance at a glance.

## Dashboard
### Market an revenue analysis
The dashboard highlights strong sales growth between 1996 and 1998, with total revenue reaching $546.68K and a significant increase in 1998 (+127.4% compared to 1997). The USA and Brazil are the top-performing markets, while some regions, such as the UK and Venezuela, show lower sales.

The best-selling product categories include beverages, dairy products, and fruits & vegetables, with notable growth in fruits and seafood. However, some segments, like condiments, have experienced a decline.

The average shipping time is around 8.78 days, with air shipping being the fastest (~7.64 days) and sea shipping the slowest (~9.51 days). A significant number of orders (129 out of 301) were shipped after more than 7 days, which may impact customer satisfaction.

Key Points:
- Strong sales growth in 1998
- High-potential markets: USA & Brazil
- High-demand products: Fruits, Seafood
- Shipping delay issues (>7 days for 43% of orders)
- Decline in sales for certain categories (e.g., condiments)

### Customer Analysis
This analysis distinguishes:
- Top 5 highest-spending customers ==> Identifies VIP/Premium customers who generate the highest revenue
- Top 5 loyal customers ==> Highlights customers who return regularly, even if their average purchase value is lower.
Jose Pavarotti, followed by Patricia McKenna and Paula Wilson, are both high-revenue-generating customers and loyal customers
